# ExamTopics Questions

This is a simple HTML-based interface to track your progress through AWS & Azure practice questions. Each question is represented as a card that links to the corresponding question page.

## Features

- ✅ **Click the button** to mark the card **green** — indicating the question is completed.
- 🔁 **Triple-click a card** (not the link) to mark it **purple** — indicating it is **marked for review**.
- 🔄 **Reset Highlights** button at the top and bottom removes all progress (green and purple states).
- 💾 Your progress is saved automatically using **local storage**. Refreshing the page will **retain your highlights**.
- 📝 A popup appears when the page first loads (only if there's no stored progress) to help you understand how to use the page.

## Instructions

1. **Single Click (Green)**  
   Click the question link to open the question in a new tab. This will mark the card green to indicate completion.

2. **Triple Click (Purple)**  
   Triple-click anywhere on the card (not the link) to mark the card for review. It will turn purple.

3. **Reset Highlights**  
   Click the **"Reset Highlights"** button at the top or bottom of the page to clear all progress (green and purple cards).
